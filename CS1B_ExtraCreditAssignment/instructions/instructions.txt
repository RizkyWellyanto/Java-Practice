Welcome to Wellyanto's Jack-Poke-pot Machine

The game is really simple: it's just a pokemon
themed Jackpot Machine.

To play, Just enter your name and the amount of money you had, and then 
click Play.
- the name must be between 1-100 characters
- the amount of money must be between $1-$1,000,000

You can slide the slider at the bottom of the Jackpot frame to control how much 
money you bet. Once you clicked Roll, the amount of bet is taken by the Jackpot 
Machine, and the three picture will be randomized. 

There are four possible pictures of pokemon: 
- Bulbasaur the green Dinosaur (50% chance)
- Charmander (25% Chance)the red lizard
- Squirtle the Blue turtle (12.5% chance)
- and Mew the Legendary Pokemon (12.5% chance)

Once the three pictures are randomized, the player will have the reward based
on the combinations of pictures that showed up:
- One Charmander will give = 5 * bet
- Two Charmander will give = 15 * bet
- Three Charmander will give = 30 * bet
- Three Bulbasaur will give = 50 * bet
- Three Mew will give = 100 * bet
- if none of these result are met, player doesn't win anything

Player lose if he/she ran out of money.
Player wins if he/she got at least $1,000,000

That's the basic instructions, Good Luck!
